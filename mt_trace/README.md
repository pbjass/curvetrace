CurveTracing
========

 This is open-source for Railway CurveTracing with ImageJ plugin for extracting, then tracing, identifying and labelling  curves on images. It modidies Carsten Steger's <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S107731421200118X">algorithm</a> by handling junctions, disappearing and re-appearing curves. It handles sharp turns and zig-zag lines and removes all alphanumeric information from the result making the daa more clean to analyze. We also extracted the curves and used spline fit to have a more smooth representation of tracks.
